# ChineseNN

Code for Experiment 1 of my PhD thesis.

- Three supervised neural networks were manually built using Matlab

- Three neural networks differed in certain aspects of the encoding of orthographic input, allowing the examination of theories concerning letter/character position coding in word processing

The four python scripts were used to generated training and testing materials for the networks.
